# Scheduling Energy Efficient Data Centers Using Renewable Energy

Energy consumption in data centers has become a critical matter, especially to large providers like Google, Facebook, and Amazon among others. The Internet industry requires more and bigger data centers to sustain its growth, but the amount of energy required for their operation has become an issue for economic and environmental reasons. In 2005, data centers accounted for around 0.5% of the total world energy consumption, while in the year 2010, it reached an estimate of 1.3%. With an estimated annual growth rate of more than 16%, forecasts are grim (Koomey, 2008, 2011). By the year 2030, the worst-case scenario estimates the electricity consumption from data centers will reach up to 13% of the total world energy (Andrae and Edler, 2015). 

Significant efforts have been made to address the aforesaid energy issues with different approaches and techniques (Dayarathna et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016). Many traditional energy saving methods focus on lowering energy consumption when computing resources are idle, or reducing the system performance when executing non-critical computing tasks, or scheduling the computational load when energy is cheaper (Nesmachnow et al., 2013; Dorronsoro et al., 2014a; Goiri et al., 2015a; Lei et al., 2016). These methods are helpful, but their effectiveness is limited because they usually lower the quality of service delivered by the data center. More recently, advances in renewable energy sources—known as green energy—have provided new ways to reduce energy consumption and the environmental impact of data centers (Wang et al., 2013). The use of green energy sources has empowered energy saving methods, enabling the scheduling of computational workload when green energy is available. Nevertheless, this remains a challenging approach since green energy sources are unreliable and depend on uncontrollable external conditions such as sun irradiation and wind velocity. Because of their unreliability, most data centers must consider a hybrid energy approach, with green energy combined with traditional energy—known as brown energy—to avoid energy outages.

When optimizing energy consumption in data centers, most approaches focus on optimizing Central Processing Units (CPUs) and cooling devices that are the most power hungry components in data centers. CPUs are, by far, the most power hungry components, using an estimated 46% of the total power consumption of a data center. The second most power hungry components are cooling devices, such as air conditioning systems, which consume an estimated of 15% of the total power. Despite the fact that cooling devices consume less energy than CPUs, they are a key focus when addressing energy consumption since they are the most inefficient components and the best candidates for improvement (Barroso et al., 2013).

This work presents a multi-objective problem formulation for optimizing the energy consumption of data centers that are powered by hybrid energy. The problem formulation addresses the scheduling of computational load and cooling devices in a data center in order to minimize its energy consumption budget, minimize the deviation of its energy consumption from a reference consumption profile, and maximize the Quality of the Service (QoS) provided to its users. Two Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) are applied for effectively solving the scheduling problem: the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm, version II (NSGA-II) (Deb et al., 2002) and the Epsilon-Variable Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (ev-MOGA) (Herrero et al., 2014). Experimental results show the proposed approach reduces energy consumption budget by about 60% while maintaining QoS over 95% and a deviation from a reference power profile of about 3%, all this compared to a traditional business as the usual data center scenario. 

This work is an extension of our previous work (Iturriaga and Nesmachnow, 2015). This work further extends it by applying ev-MOGA and comparing its accuracy with NSGA-II when addressing the proposed problem. In addition to this, a larger and more diverse set of problem instances are evaluated and a more thorough multi-objective experimental analysis with statistical support
is provided.
