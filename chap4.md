# Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for energy and service-level scheduling in a federation of distributed datacenters

Datacenters are large supercomputing facilities hosting many computing resources that provide multiple services, including computing power, networking, storage, etc. Nowadays, datacenters are being used in different application domains, most notably including science, industry and commerce (Khan and Zomaya, 2015).

The new paradigms for computation that propose using geographically distributed infrastructures to deal with large-scale complex problems (i.e. grid and cloud computing) have gained notorious interest due to the emergence of modern datacenter facilities and parallel computing methodologies and libraries. A common infrastructure for large-scale computing is a federation of distributed datacenters, i.e. a set of datacenters organized to work cooperatively as a single-image computing resource. Indeed, such a federation of datacenters provides a significantly large amount of computing power to be used in modern supercomputing applications. Each datacenter in a federation is typically composed by a large number of heterogeneous computational resources, including high performance clusters, large storage systems, and/or components of large grids or cloud systems (Zomaya and Lee, 2012).

Energy efficiency is a very relevant issue for datacenter operation and has become a major concern when using complex computing infrastructures (Ahmad and Ranka, 2012). Recent surveys reveal that datacenters and high performance computing facilities account for about 1.5% of the total world energy usage (Koomey, 2011), and for each datacenter, the electricity bills represent about 5% of the total cost of ownership (Barroso and Hölzle, 2009). As a consequence, datacenters’ owners and operators are interested in maintaining the energy consumption as low as possible, for both economic and environmental reasons. However, the energy efficiency management is in conflict with the performance of the system, since increasing the performance requires using more energy, and reducing the energy consumption will negatively affect the Quality of Service (QoS) that the datacenter provides to the users. This is a complex problem that requieres a multiobjective analysis for finding accurate solutions of the datacenter planning problem, providing different trade-offs between energy consumption and performance.

Different techniques for reducing the energy consumption in datacenters have been proposed, ranging from ad-hoc hardware solutions to more general software methods for specific infrastructures (Ahmad and Ranka, 2012; Dorronsoro et al., 2014a; Iturriaga and Nesmachnow, 2015; Nesmachnow et al., 2015; Tchernykh et al., 2015; Valentini et al., 2013; Khan and Zomaya, 2015). This article presents the application of MultiObjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) for energy-aware scheduling of workloads with deadlines into a federation of distributed datacenters. Similar problems have been tackled by Abrishami et al. (2013) and Schwiegelshohn and Tchernykh (2012). The computing infrastructure considered in this work is composed by a number of clusters that might be geographically distributed. This is indeed the architecture of modern high performance computing systems, including supercomputers, high performance computing centers, and cloud infrastructures, among others. We specifically tackle scenarios with high performance computing applications which require high computing usage and low networking and storage usage. Thus, we approximate the energy consumed by each machine with the energy consumed by its central processing units.

A hierarchical two-level approach is applied (Dorronsoro et al., 2014a; Quezada-Pina et al., 2012), which divides the scheduling problem into a number of simpler and smaller sub-problems to be solved in each component of the datacenter federation. Scheduling heuristics and MOEAs are used to assign groups of worflows submitted by the users to each datacenter. Then, specific ad-hoc backfilling heuristics considering makespan, energy consumption, and QoS of solutions, are applied for scheduling within each datacenter.

This work is an extension of our previous conference paper, presented in the VIII ALIO/EURO Workshop on Applied Combinatorial Optimization (Montevideo, Uruguay, 2014), in which a hierarchical method was presented for energy-aware scheduling of large workloads into a distributed computing system (Nesmachnow et al., 2014a). That work contributed to the literature with a novel hierarchical model that uses two levels for assigning workflows to a number of geographically distributed resources, that allows scheduling a large number of workflows of tasks with dependencies. 

The contributions of this work are: (i) a reformulation of the problem, including a user-oriented perspective by considering Service Level Agreement (SLA) contracts with customers over a heterogeneous federated datacenter; (ii) the resolution of the problem with versions of well-known scheduling heuristics adapted to the problem, and two new MOEAs specifically designed and implemented for the problem formulation proposed; (iii) the computation of new lower bounds for the problem, using a Constraint Programming (CP) methodology for estimation; and (iv) the use of large datacenters in the experimental analysis, the biggest one composed of over 1, 500 processing elements, a more realistic computational infrastructure than those in the instances used in our previous work.

We evaluated the studied schedulers with a set of 175 instances, including 50 medium size workloads—used to compute lower bounds for the problem objectives—and 125 workloads with large workflows that model typical high performance computing applications over realistic distributed infrastructures. As in our previous work (Dorronsoro et al., 2014a), five different classes of workloads are considered, namely Series-Parallel, Heterogeneous-Parallel, Homogeneous-Parallel, Single-Task, and Mix. The workloads of all problem instances contain 1000 workflows, with up to 132 tasks each, to be scheduled in a federation of datacenters with around 3, 000 computational units. Experimental results demonstrate that the MOEA schedulers compute accurate solutions with more than 37 solutions that outperform the best studied heuristic on all three objectives.
