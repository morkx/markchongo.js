# Energy aware multiobjective scheduling in a federation of heterogeneous datacenters

This work presents the application of a two-level scheduling approach that combines a MultiObjective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) and specific ad-hoc backfilling heuristics for energy-aware planning of workloads into a federation of heterogeneous distributed datacenters, taking into account taskâ€™s dependencies and quality of service (QoS) provided by the datacenter. The reported research extends the approach presented in Chapter 4 by considering a fully heterogeneous approach for both workloads and computing elements, a realistic assumption for nowadays high performance computing infrastructures (Ren et al., 2015). Furthermore, we extend our experimental analysis by designing and studying three different high-level MOEA schedulers and several high-level heuristic schedulers. The experimental analysis is performed over a set of 100 realistic problem instances considering both small- and large-sized scenarios. These problem instances are comprised of five different types of computing workflows, sampling a wide range of realistic high-performance applications. Each problem instance, disregarding its type, is comprised of 1000 computing workflows, each of which is comprised of a number of tasks ranging from 1 up to 132.

The main results indicate that the proposed MOEA outperforms the most accurate greedy heuristics with a makespan improvement of 32%, energy consumption improvement of 6%, and QoS improvement of 29%.
